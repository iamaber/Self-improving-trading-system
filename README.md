# Stock Price Predictor (LSTM-based)

This project is a web-based application for predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. It enables users to visualize historical stock data, evaluate model performance, forecast future prices, and analyze market trends through interactive charts. The model can be easily fine-tuned with new data to keep predictions up-to-date.

## üöÄ Features

- **Historical Data Visualization:** Interactive charts of past stock prices.
- **LSTM Model Training/Fine-tuning:** Train or fine-tune an LSTM model using historical and newly fetched data (trained on the 'Close' price).
- **Historical Prediction Performance:** Compare actual vs. predicted prices to assess model accuracy.
- **Error Metrics:** View RMSE, MAE, and a distribution plot of prediction errors.
- **Future Price Forecasting:** Forecast future stock prices for various horizons (e.g., 7, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 days).
- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Automatically fetches the latest stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Market Analysis Charts:**
    - Daily Trading Volume
    - Close Price with Moving Averages (50-day, 200-day)
    - Daily Returns Distribution
- **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard:** User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     cd stock_predictor
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     If `requirements.txt` is missing, create one with:
     ```
     torch
     pandas
     scikit-learn
     yfinance
     streamlit
     plotly
     numpy
     ```

4. **Data and Pre-trained Model Setup**
     - The repository includes `google_stock_prices_2015_2024.csv`, `best_stock_model.pth`, and `scaler.pkl`. These are ready for use, so you can skip initial training if you want to use the provided model.

5. **(Optional) Train/Fine-tune the LSTM Model**
     - To train or fine-tune with the latest data:
         ```bash
         python train.py
         ```
     - This will:
         - Load `google_stock_prices_2015_2024.csv`
         - Fetch new GOOGL data from 2025-01-01 to present
         - Combine datasets and train/fine-tune the model
         - Save updated `best_stock_model.pth` and `scaler.pkl`

6. **Run the Streamlit Application**
     ```bash
     streamlit run streamlit_app.py
     ```
     - This opens the app in your web browser.
