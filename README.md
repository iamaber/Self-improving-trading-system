Stock Price Predictor (LSTM-based)
This project provides a web-based application for predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. It allows users to visualize historical stock data, see the model's performance on past data, forecast future prices, and analyze market trends through various interactive charts. The model is designed to be easily fine-tuned with new data to keep its predictions up-to-date.

üöÄ Features
Historical Data Visualization: View interactive charts of past stock prices.

LSTM Model Training/Fine-tuning: Train or fine-tune an LSTM model using historical and newly fetched data. The model is trained on the 'Close' price only.

Historical Prediction Performance: See how well the model predicts past stock prices (Actual vs. Predicted) to gauge its accuracy.

Error Metrics: Quantifiable metrics (RMSE, MAE) and a distribution plot of prediction errors on historical data.

Future Price Forecasting: Generate forecasts for future stock prices for various horizons (e.g., 7, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 days).

Real-time Data Fetching: Automatically fetches the latest stock data from Yahoo Finance for fine-tuning and analysis.

Market Analysis Charts:

Daily Trading Volume.

Close Price with Moving Averages (50-day, 200-day).

Daily Returns Distribution.

Interactive Streamlit Dashboard: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3.x

PyTorch: For building and training the LSTM model.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing (MinMaxScaler).

yfinance: For fetching historical stock market data.

Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.

Plotly: For interactive data visualizations.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

data_fetcher.py: Handles fetching historical stock data from Yahoo Finance and standardizing its format.

model.py: Defines the LSTM neural network architecture (StockLSTM).

predict.py: Contains functions for loading the trained model and scaler, and making future stock price predictions.

train.py: Script for training (or fine-tuning) the LSTM model and saving the trained model (best_stock_model.pth) and the data scaler (scaler.pkl).

streamlit_app.py: The main Streamlit application script that integrates all components for the web dashboard.

google_stock_prices_2015_2024.csv: An initial dataset of Google stock prices (GOOGL) used for initial model training.

best_stock_model.pth: The pre-trained weights of the LSTM model.

scaler.pkl: The pre-fitted MinMaxScaler used for data preprocessing.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with your actual repository URL
cd stock_predictor

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't have a requirements.txt file, create one and add the following, then run pip install -r requirements.txt:

torch
pandas
scikit-learn
yfinance
streamlit
plotly
numpy

4. Data and Pre-trained Model Setup
The repository includes the google_stock_prices_2015_2024.csv dataset, the best_stock_model.pth (pre-trained model weights), and scaler.pkl (pre-fitted data scaler). These files are ready for use, so you can skip the initial training step if you wish to use the provided model.

If you want to re-train or fine-tune the model with the latest data, proceed to step 5.

5. (Optional) Train/Fine-tune the LSTM Model
If you want to train the model from scratch or fine-tune it with the very latest data, run this script:

python train.py

This script will:

Load the google_stock_prices_2015_2024.csv data.

Fetch any new data for GOOGL from 2025-01-01 to the current date.

Combine the historical and new data.

Train/fine-tune the StockLSTM model on the 'Close' price feature of this combined dataset.

Save the updated best_stock_model.pth and scaler.pkl files, overwriting the included ones.

6. Run the Streamlit Application
Once the necessary files (.pth, .pkl) are present (either from the repository or generated by train.py), you can launch the interactive web application:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

This command will open the Streamlit app in your web browser.

üöÄ Usage
Once the Streamlit app is running:

Select Forecast Horizon: Use the slider in the sidebar to choose how many days into the future you want to predict (e.g., 7, 30, 60, 90 etc. days).

Fine-tune Model: Click the "Fine-tune Model with Latest Data" button in the sidebar to update the model with the most recent stock data available. This is useful for keeping your predictions current.

Navigate Tabs:

Forecast & Performance: View the future price forecast, the model's historical performance (Actual vs. Predicted), and quantitative error metrics (RMSE, MAE) along with an error distribution.

Market Analysis: Explore additional charts like Trading Volume, Moving Averages, and Daily Returns Distribution for deeper market insights.

Raw Data: Inspect the raw historical data used by the model and the full dataset used for analysis.
